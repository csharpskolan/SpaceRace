# SpaceRace
A pixel art moon lander game written in C# and MonoGame.

The basic resolution is 480x270 pixels as it scales evenly to 1920x1080. The aim was to keep a nice pixel art feeling and scaling and yet have a "sub pixel" movement of objects for more fluid motions.
Start the game and change resolution with the 1,2,3 and 4 number keys. 

The aim is to land the space ship on the landing pad before fuel or time runs out!
